# locating a single serial in the DNAC GUI is a simple tasks but if there are a half dozen or more it can be manually tedious
# this scrip takes an input file serials.csv with a single column A containing serials numbers to search for
# it will search the DNA center inventory for those serials numbers and output the finding to file serials-found.csv
# serials-found.csv will have the serials listed in column A and the device where found in column B
# in addition to the output file, the findings will be printed interactively to the screen
#
# BASE_URL will need to be update with the IP address of your DNAC, or in the case of a cluster, the DNAC VIP

#deleloped with Python 3.6
